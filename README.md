##FlairJS - True Object Oriented JavaScript##
Powerful .Net/Java style object oriented concepts in plain vanilla JavaScript.

All basic object oriented concepts like, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, events, together with advance features like aspect oriented and attribute based programming, custom attributes, serialization, 
dependency injection and reflection, etc. are all nicely baked in this tiny javascript library.
All of these are available via pure JavaScript syntax, without any build-time transpilation or compilation 
of your codebase.
                  
The forward-looking and future-proof design of the library, plays well with ongoing Ecmascript advancements, and uses available new JavaScript constructs behind the scenes, wherever possible and supported.

This works in web browsers and in other JavaScript environments like Node and NW.js.

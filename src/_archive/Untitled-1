at all membernames in exception, make type name as prefix
replace all exceptions with const values

create attribute for these
    publish: new _attrConfig('event', '!@publish'),
    fetch: new _attrConfig('func', 'async, !abstract'),
    
test if Type1 has a staticProp1 and Type2 derives from Type1 and has staticProp1 as well and Type3 derives from Type1 and has staticProp1 
what will be values --- ideally they all should be different because these are at individual static level

NO NEED fOR RESET API ANYWHERE

also think - Enum definiton creator can itself create a factory to handle object literal and
then pass this factory with static members etc. defined and code to add properties like

first add: _attr('static');

Then create factory:

let _factory = function() {
    for(let prop of objectLiteral) {
        if (prop is own property) {
            this[prop] = value
        }
    }
}

consider having inbuilt 'flag' attribute as well, which will allow enum values to behave as flags
and then pass this factory function to def

Some extensions to Types like
GetAttributes

and some for Objects too like
toString
etc.

Like every sInstance have these methods etc.

constructor is always overridden 


check for inheritance members check, some may still need to be available like isInher...



// therefore constructor in an static class cannot take arguments - warn by checking constructor parameters - also don't



replace all exceptions with const values

in proxy detech for abstract and interface types - use only noop and null values


create attribute for these
    publish: new _attrConfig('event', '!@publish'),
    fetch: new _attrConfig('func', 'async, !abstract'),

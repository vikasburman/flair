both in aspoects and attributes application move function/event members to newly wrapped item
check at central place what attributes can be applied on what members
applyAttrs and weaving should also consider obj vs staticInterface
doubel check all has(attrName, name) calls to see where deepCheck is to be done and where current is to be ignored or only current needs to be checked
publish attr should publish event outside to pub/sub
